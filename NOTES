* Zotonic module manager
** TODOs
- TODO refactor codebase
- TODO Lock site module deps with "deps.lock" like mix lock files
- TODO npm style output: ANSI colours, and verbose etc
- TODO Integrate either epax or mad
- TODO download by branch, commit hash
- TODO cache downloaded files
- TODO Upload new website: Heroku and get the database dump from Arjan
- TODO Update REST API
- TODO Add dependency solver
- TODO Register module from CLI
  For example: zmm register packageName git://your/git/url.git

** IDEAS
- EPM: https://github.com/jkvor/epm
Currently, Zotonic has no way of specifying the modules required to run a site. I think dependency (or package) management should be added to Zotonic for at least two reasons:

    When other developers check out a site, they can install all its modules by enabling the site (or perhaps running a console command) instead of manually following steps in a readme.
    When the site is deployed to production, its modules can be installed automatically.

A proposal (as discussed with @arjan) is to take the install_modules section in the site config more seriously by:

    actually installing the modules that are listed there
    adding the possibility to specify a Git repository for unofficial modules
    adding version requirements (either a tag or a commit hash for untagged material).

Cf. for instance how Composer, the PHP package manager, defines requirements. Bower does something similar for frontend dependencies, and package.json for NPM.

- different build/custom script for certain dependencies, in cases
